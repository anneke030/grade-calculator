<h1><strong>Grade Calculator for my Fall 2024 UT Courses</strong></h1>

This application is meant to calculate my semester averages for each of the courses I'm taking in Fall 2024. The calculator is meant to work at any given time in the semester, working only with the inputs (asignment grades) it receives and disregarding empty inputs.<br/>
<br/>
I am utilizing HTML/CSS for frontend and Python for backend, and am constructing the website using the Flask framework.<br/>
<br/>
This is my first time using Flask as well as deploying an original website of mine, so the project focuses on relatively basic application of the languages and framework I'm using. I'm learning a lot while I make this, and I'm neverthless very proud of what I've been able to accomplish so far :)
